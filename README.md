# MusicRecommendationSystem

This project explores users’ listening history to build a collaborative-filtering song recommendation system. First, a popularity model is built as a baseline using two methods of determining popularity. Then, a Latent Factor Model is built using the Alternating Least Square (ALS) algorithm provided in Spark’s library. Additionally, a single-machine approach using LightFM is implemented for comparison.
